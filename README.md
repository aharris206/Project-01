• Aster - A couple of additions I added that may have been pushed to the main branch. 
I wrote the `fire_acre_burn.ipynb`, `fire_acre_burn_soCal.ipynb`, and `fire_data_graphs.ipynb` files which grabbed and plotted data off fire.ca.gov, turned the `ISO 8601` Timestamps it provided into `UNIX` Timestams in order to create a Months column via binning and saved them to CSV. *these can be seen in the `cleaned_csv` file under `Resources`*
I also wrote the `CSV_cleaner.ipynb` file as a group resource to aid us all in cleaning up some of our CSVs (:
